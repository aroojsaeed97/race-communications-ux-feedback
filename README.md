# Race Communications Website Beta – UX & Content Feedback

## Overview
As part of my role at Race Communications, I was given early access to review the beta version of our new website. I provided detailed feedback on usability, content clarity, and mobile accessibility to help improve the user experience and functionality.

## Key Suggestions & Contributions

1. **Pricing Transparency**
   - Observed that static pricing on the homepage could be misleading due to the price escalator, tech assurance, and other factors.
   - Suggested adding a note advising customers to contact sales/support for current pricing.

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Identified that the Race Dashboard is not mobile-friendly.
   - Recommended mobile responsiveness to improve accessibility for on-the-go users.

3. **Careers Page Optimization**
   - Noted that the recruiting email was missing on the Careers page.
   - Suggested adding a direct contact point for applicants to improve communication.

## Outcome
The feedback was positively received and acknowledged by the Chief of Staff. These observations contribute to Race Communications’ mission of improving transparency and delivering a smooth digital experience for our customers.
